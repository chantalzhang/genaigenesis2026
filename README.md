# Agent<sup>2</sup>

[![Built at GenAI Genesis 2026](https://img.shields.io/badge/GenAI_Genesis-2026-blue)](#)

**Your real estate agent <ins>agent</ins>.** Text a number, take a short call, and get matched home listings sent to your phone. No apps, no accounts, no browsing.

## What is this?

Agent<sup>2</sup> is an end-to-end AI-powered home buying assistant. A user texts our number, receives a call from an AI voice agent (Mary), describes what kind of home they want in plain conversation, and gets real listings texted back — then we contact the listing agent on their behalf.

1. **Listens** to the conversation via a Telnyx + PersonaPlex voice pipeline
2. **Extracts** structured search criteria (location, budget, bedrooms, features, etc.) from the transcript using an LLM
3. **Scrapes** Zillow for matching listings with filtered search URLs, scores them against the criteria, and ranks by fit
4. **Contacts agents** on the caller's behalf by automating the "Contact Agent" form on Zillow with Playwright

The whole flow — from a spoken sentence like *"I'm looking for a two-bedroom house in Toronto, under 800k, pet-friendly"* to a filled-out contact form on a real listing — is automated.

## How it works

```
User texts Agent² number
        │
        ▼
  SMS greeting → user replies YES
        │
        ▼
  AI calls user back (Telnyx + PersonaPlex voice agent "Mary")
        │
        ▼
  Full-duplex conversation with AEC + RNNoise audio pipeline
        │
        ▼
  Transcript extracted (faster-whisper) → LLM extracts search criteria
        │
        ▼
  Zillow searched with filtered URLs (price, beds, baths, location)
        │
        ▼
  Listings scored, ranked, deduped → LLM picks best match
        │
        ▼
  Top listing sent to user via SMS
        │
        ▼
  User replies YES → contact agent form filled (Playwright)
  User replies NO  → asks why → re-searches with feedback
```

### Audio Pipeline (per call)

```
Caller mic (8kHz) → SpeexDSP AEC → RNNoise → upsample 24kHz → PersonaPlex
                         ▲
PersonaPlex out → downsample 8kHz → feed as AEC reference → send to caller
```

- **SpeexDSP AEC**: Removes model echo using playback reference signal (~20ms)
- **RNNoise**: Neural noise suppression for background noise (~10ms, pipelined)
- **Total overhead**: ~20ms — duplex/barge-in preserved

                                                      (1hr) → searching      re-search with feedback
```

Text **RESET** at any time to clear your session and start over.

## Quick demo (end-to-end)

```bash
python run_e2e.py
```

This will:
1. Read `trans.txt` (sample call transcript)
2. Call the LLM to extract search criteria
3. Scrape Zillow for matching listings
4. Open a browser and fill the "Contact Agent" form on the top listing

---

## Run individual pieces

### Extract search criteria from a transcript

```python
from app.agents.build_search_criteria import extract_search_criteria

criteria = extract_search_criteria(open("trans.txt").read())
```

### Scrape Zillow listings

```python
from data.zillow.scraper import search

results = search(criteria)
# results["matches"]  — listings that fit all criteria
# results["nearest"]  — close alternatives with violations
```

### Contact an agent on a listing

```python
from app.contact import Lead, run_contact_flow

result = run_contact_flow(
    "https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/...",
    Lead(),
    mode="preview",
    headless=False,
)
```

### Run tests

```bash
python -m pytest tests/ -v -s
```

## Search criteria schema

The LLM extracts this from a conversation:

```json
{
  "location": { "query": "Toronto", "city": "Toronto", "state_province": "ON" },
  "intent": "buy",
  "price": { "min": 500000, "max": 1000000 },
  "bedrooms": { "min": 3, "max": null },
  "bathrooms": { "min": 2, "max": null },
  "property_type": ["house"],
  "features": {
    "required": ["pet_friendly", "near_schools"],
    "nice_to_have": ["parking", "basement"]
  }
}
```

Price always includes both min and max. Location always includes province/state abbreviation for Canadian/US cities.

---

## Listing scoring

Each listing is scored against criteria:

- **Price**: within budget = +0.3, over budget = penalty scaled by overshoot
- **Bedrooms/bathrooms**: meeting minimums = bonus, below = violation
- **Property type**: matched from title/URL
- **Features**: checked from detail page. Required missing = violation; nice-to-have = bonus
- **Deduplication**: seen listings tracked per session, never sent twice

Listings split into **exact matches** and **nearest alternatives** (ranked by score, violations listed).

---

## Feedback prompt injection

When a user rejects a listing, the system doesn't just move to the next result — it learns from the rejection in real time.

```
User receives listing → replies NO
        │
        ▼
  "What didn't you like about it?"
        │
        ▼
  User: "Too far from downtown" or "No backyard" or "Too expensive"
        │
        ▼
  Rejection reason stored in session → injected into LLM ranking prompt
        │
        ▼
  Next search: LLM sees all prior rejection feedback when picking the best listing
```

### How it works

Each session maintains a `rejection_reasons` list. Every time the user says NO and explains why, their feedback is appended:

```python
session["rejection_reasons"].append("Too far from transit, I need something walkable")
session["rejection_reasons"].append("No parking, that's a dealbreaker")
```

When the LLM ranks the next batch of listings, all accumulated rejection feedback is injected directly into the ranking prompt:

```
User rejection feedback from previous listings:
Too far from transit, I need something walkable
No parking, that's a dealbreaker

Listings (index: address — price — beds/baths — match score — violations):
0: 123 Main St — $750,000 — 3 bed/2 bath — score: 1.45 — violations: []
1: 456 Oak Ave — $680,000 — 3 bed/2 bath — score: 1.30 — violations: []
...

Pick the single best listing for this user.
```

The LLM uses this context to avoid repeating the same mistakes — if the user said "too far from downtown," it will favor central listings even if a suburban one scores higher on paper. This creates a **conversational refinement loop** where each rejection makes the next suggestion smarter, without re-extracting criteria or re-running the voice call.

The page counter also increments on each rejection, pulling fresh Zillow results so the user never sees the same listing twice.
